    "description": "OverTheWire - Pentesting Notes",
    "content": "Shook the rust off of Visual Studio Code and was surprised to find a well documented directory w/ Dockerfile and docker-compose file running kali linux with a dozen or so shell scripts for a wargame called ```Bandit```.\nThe wargame is from a webapp called OverTheWire which offers free wargames to practice pentesting skills, link here -> https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/\nEach level of the Bandit wargame has you break into a linux virtual machine, the previous level's task guides you to a password, which you need to login to the next level's virtual machine.\nThis summer I took some classes in Calculus and Physics and this was a good way stretching out my command line and scripting skills for upcoming interviews.\nA summary of some of the commands I used:\n- sshpass - automates the process of ssh into a VM, allows you to run commands upon logging in\n- grep - searches plaintext\n- find - directory search, using syntax, filesize, expressive options\n- 2>/dev/null - when you want to throw away garbage\n- cut - extracts text from each line of a file\n- sort - sorts lines from a textfile\n- uniq - fed lines from standard input or a file, outputs only unique text\n- strings - extract strings from a binary file\n- base64 - and encoder and decoder, to help transmit data over a network w/o running into errors\n- tr - traslates or deletes characters, useful if you want implement ROT13 or the Caesar cipher\n- mktemp - creates temporary folder/file\n- xxd - hexdump or the reverse\n- gzip - compression tool, header is \\x1F\\x8B\\x08\n- bzip2 - compression tool, header is 425a, the next byte gives the version\n- tar - compress to/from archive\n- scp - copy files \n\nThe code can be found here -> https://github.com/trmchale1/hacking"

    "description": "git reset --hard",
    "content": "Today I ran a command I would use rarely, and if it were in a workplace environment, would actually be a pretty big deal.\n\n``` git reset --hard 6894f6e1...```\n\nLike an artist, you have to look at your work and realize that some of it is utter junk and needs to be thrown out. Bad code smells. \n\nIt smells like 1000+ lines of code changes, with changes to configs that indicate potential dependency conflicts.\n\nIn this case I wanted to integrate RainbowKit to my personal website timmchale.co, the css in this new download clashed with my current css and postprocessing.\n\nI spent several days debugging dependency issues and deleting core functionality of the Gatsby app that I started with.\n\nNow I am realizing I built my web-app with Gatsby, which was fine for a one page app with simple html like functionality, but I need to go with Next.js for improved routing functionality.\n\nKeeping code small, with simple workflows consistently works for me. Any time I put too much functionality together, things tend to break.\n\nI used ```git reset``` because I wanted to change where the HEAD was pointing at, this command alters previous history, going back in time, so to speak.\n\nI felt I needed to use reset because the branch I started the dev work in had already been merged with a long history into the main branch. And I wanted that history removed as well.\n\nIn most cases when correcting the mistake of just one commit, you want to use the ```git revert``` command, github's user interface has a good revert feature in the pull request tab."
